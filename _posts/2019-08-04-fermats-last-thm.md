I am currently reading "Fermat's Last Theorem" by Simon Singh. It is very a interesting account of the history of the problem
and a young boy's ([Andrew Wiles]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Wiles)) journey towards solving it.

I will write more about the book after I finish it, but here's the statement of the theorem,

There exist no positive integers a, b, c that satisfy the equation $$a^n + b^n = c^n$$ for any integer n greater than 2
