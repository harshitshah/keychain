I am Harshit Shah. An engineer enthusiastic about mathematics, programming, mathematical aspects of programming, music, etc.

I intend to use this blog as a "keychain" of interesting ideas.

This is where I write about things I find interesting (maths, algorithms, books, music, etc).
Hope you you find them interesting too!
